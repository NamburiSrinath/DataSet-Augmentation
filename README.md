# Dataset Augmentation with Latent Diffusion Models
In this project, we have considered augmenting a dataset using synthetic images generated by Latent Diffusion Models.  We have evaluated our datasets on a resNet-18 model on classes from CIFAR 10. Currently we have evaluated model on a custom dataset obtained from different source. We want to move to a standard dataset in the near future.
